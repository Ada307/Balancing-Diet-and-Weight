## Balancing Diet & Weight Management System
This project is a machine-learning based health analytics tool built using a self-collected dietary & lifestyle dataset. It analyzes user habits, performs predictive modeling and generates personalized diet & exercise recommendations.
The system focuses on understanding how daily lifestyle choices—such as sleep, steps, meals, water intake, exercise frequency and stress—impact weight goals.

## 1. Dataset
This dataset is **self-collected** and includes factors like diet, steps, sleep, health, stress, meals and weight goals.
It captures real human behavior and lifestyle choices, making the model more practical and personalized.

## 2. Machine Learning Models Used
For Classification -	Random Forest Classifier that predicts weight change success.
For Regression - Random Forest Regressor that	predicts estimated time to reach goal.
For Clustering - K-Means that groups users by lifestyle & habits.

## 3. Key Features
#**Generates useful metrics like:**
BMI, Sleep hours, Sedentary hours, Meals per day, Water intake, Exercise intensity, Meal category (breakfast, lunch, dinner)

#**Predicts whether a person is likely to see weight changes (“success”) based on their habits.**
#**Estimates how many days it will take to reach their goal (weight loss or weight gain).**

#**Real-Time User Input:**
Allows entering: Age, gender, Height & weight, Sleep, steps, sedentary hours, Diet patterns, Junk food frequency, Lifestyle metrics
And returns: Success probability, Estimated days to goal, Diet plan, Exercise plan
